        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>It all started in a small kitchen filled with the aroma of warm vanilla and freshly baked bread. Sweet Treats Bakery was born from 
            a lifelong passion for baking, passed down through generations.</p>
        
        <p>In 2020, our founder, Emma Collins, decided to turn her grandmother's 
            cherished recipes into a business that could bring joy to others. What began as a small home-based  bakery
            with a team of 4 people bakery quickly became a local favorite, known for its handcrafted cakes, 
            soft pastries, and artisan bread made with love and the finest organic ingredients.</p>
        
        <p>At Sweet Treats Bakery, we believe that every bite should tell a storyâ€”one of tradition, warmth,
             and happiness. Whether it's a birthday cake, a weekend croissant, 
             or a simple loaf of sourdough, our mission is to make life a little sweeter, one treat at a time.</p>
        
        <p>Today, our bakery continues to serve the community with the same dedication and passion that started it all.
             Come visit us and taste the love in every bite!</p>
